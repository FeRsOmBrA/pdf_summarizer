Coal bed methane (CBM) has recently been produced from sub-bituminous to high volatile bituminous low rank 
coals (vitrinite reflectance 0.39 to 0.53%) from the Paleocene Cuervos Formation in the Cesar Sub-basin, 
Colombia. Understanding CBM gas origin is vital for designing exploration and production strategies, in order 
to target either shallow economic accumulations of microbial gas or deeper and thermally mature coal seams. In 
this context, this study aims to determine whether thermogenic gas, biogenic gas, or a mixture of both gas types 
have contributed to gas yield in the Cesar Sub-basin; it also discusses the relationship between gas origin and 
tectonics. For the first time, co-produced waters and gas samples from CBM multi-seam production wells and 
shallow aquifer water-wells were collected in the Boqueron compartment (Cesar Sub-basin) and were analysed 
via stable isotope composition and molecular geochemistry. Structural compartmentalisation in the Sub-basin as 
a result of interplate shortening during the Mid-Paleogene has resulted in slightly different coal ranks, saturation, 
and gas contents between compartments of the Paleocene Cuervos Formation. This event could have interrupted 
early thermogenesis and allowed the introduction of meteoric waters carrying bacteria consortia responsible for 
biogenesis. 
The produced waters from the CBM wells were HCO3 > Na+ > Cl−type, and ranged in TDS (Total dissolved 
solids) from 2268 to 6602 mg/L (avg. 3887 mg/L). Recently revised genetic diagrams of δ13C-CH4 versus δ2H- 
CH4 and additional parameters, such as gas dryness ratio and water chemistry, corroborated biogenesis as the 
main gas origin. Carbon isotopic differences between carbon dioxide and methane (Δ13CH2O–CH4), as well as 
those of hydrogen isotopes in water and methane (Δ2HH2O–CH4), also indicated a typical microbial CO2 reduction 
pathway. The positive carbon isotope composition of dissolved inorganic carbon (δ13C-DIC) not only showed a 
clear differentiation between waters from CBM wells and those from shallow aquifers, but also confirmed the 
occurrence of methanogenesis when paired with high alkalinity. In addition, the water quality analysis showed 
increasing sodium and bicarbonate concentrations with depth, which is typical of CBM production basins. 
Although biogenic gas was identified, tectonic settings do not seem to explain gas origin occurrence, since 
secondary biogenesis was expected in an uplifted basin such as Cesar Rancheria. Isotopic data was not decisive in 
differentiating primary versus secondary biogenesis, since the gas isotope compositions plot close to the 
boundary between the primary and secondary biogenic gas fields. Further studies on isotopic chemistry are 
required to refine this interpretation and confirm gas generation in the other two compartments.   
1. Introduction 
Successful coal bed methane (CBM) exploration strategies require an 
understanding of gas origin (Hamilton et al., 2020; Mastalerz and 
Drobniak, 2020; Rice, 1993). Microbial targets are generally found at 
shallow depths, in connection with hydrodynamic systems that bring 
microbes into the coal beds. This can result in higher gas saturation due 
to microbial enhancement. Thermogenic accumulations tend to occur in 
deeper coal beds at higher ranks, typically with higher gas content and 
less permeable coal. Gases with mixed origins may present a number of 
challenges, including over or under pressures and variable CO2 content, 
among others (Scott et al., 1994). 
Biogenic methane is formed in two ways. Primary biogenic gas is 
produced during the early stages of coalification through the conversion

of organic matter by microbial fermentative processes. This typically 
occurs at shallow depths and lower temperatures (Pramod et al., 2014). 
Secondary biogenic generation, on the other hand, requires shallow 
coals in which reservoir temperature is low (generally <56 ◦C), as well 
as the presence of water carrying methanogens, and generally occurs 
after uplift cycles (Pramod et al., 2014). Thermogenic gas origin in­
volves the thermal decomposition of coal above 100 ◦C (Gao et al., 
2014), generally at greater depths and higher coal ranks (>0.7% Ro) 
(Scott et al., 1994). A mixture of both biogenic and thermogenic gas 
origins has been reported in many basins, including the Illinois Basin, 
USA (Moore et al., 2018), the Raniganj Basin, India (Ghosh et al., 2018), 
the Surat and Bowen basins, Australia (Baublys et al., 2015; Boreham 
et al., 1998; Hamilton et al., 2020; Kinnon et al., 2010), and the Powder 
River Basin, USA (Quillinan and Frost, 2014). 
Geochemical systematics for the interpretation of gas origin combine 
genetic isotopic diagrams, gas molecular composition, and water 
hydrogeochemistry. In conjunction with geological data, well comple­
tion, and production data, these systematics provide common tools for 
the identification of thermal and microbial gas origins (Golding et al., 
2013; Hamilton et al., 2020; Hamilton et al., 2015; Milkov and Etiope, 
2018; Moore et al., 2018; Vinson et al., 2017). 
The Cesar Rancheria Basin (CRB), situated in the north Caribbean 
region of Colombia, is one of the most productive thermal coal basins in 
South America and a potential target for CBM exploration and devel­
opment. This basin has been geographically and geologically divided 
into two Sub-basins: the north-east Rancheria Sub-basin, and the south- 
west Cesar Sub-basin (ANH, 2011) (Fig. 1). Previous studies have 
identified CBM potential in this basin; however, there has been insuffi­
cient research on the origin of co-produced water and gases, methano­
genic pathways, and controlling factors of gas content. Two possible 
scenarios for CBM gas occurrence in the basin have been hypothesised. 
First, the hypothesis of thermogenesis for the Mid Paleocene to the Late 
Paleocene Cuervos Formation in the Cesar Sub-basin (CSB) is based on 
its sufficient burial depth, temperature, and pressure. In this regard, 
recent geochemical studies in the Rancheria Sub-basin have shown that 
the Cerrejon Formation (stratigraphically equivalent to Cuervos For­
mation in CSB), despite having mixed organic matter type II/III kerogen, 
has not reached the oil generation window, thus limiting the confir­
mation of thermally generated gas (Cruz-Ceballos et al., 2020). Second, 
the low coal rank opens the possibility of secondary biogenesis resulting 
from the interaction of meteoric waters with the coal-bearing strata. 
This study aimed to determine whether the gas yield in the Cesar 
Sub-basin was thermogenic and/or biogenic in origin. To do so, it ana­
lysed stable isotopes of hydrogen, carbon and oxygen in water, methane,

and CO2 (δ2H-H2O, δ18O-H2O, δ13C-CO2, δ2H-CH4, δ13C-CH4) and δ13C- 
DIC (dissolved inorganic carbon), along with paired hydrogeochemical 
data from CBM pilot production wells in the CRB. Existing datasets of 
coal-bearing stratigraphy, gas desorption, and coal properties were also 
analysed to provide context for the geochemical data. The results of this 
study have significant implications for gas production performance, and 
for environmental issues associated with gas production in Colombia; 
for instance, in the excessive dewatering time (e.g. Quillinan and Frost, 
2014), and connectivity of hydrocarbons with adjacent aquifers (e.g. 
Charlotte et al., 2015). In the following sections, we will outline the 
geological settings and general gas content domains, followed by the 
isotopic evidence for gas and water origins. 
2. Geological and hydrogeological setting 
The Cesar Rancheria Basin (CRB) is an N30◦E oriented intermontane 
basin located in the north-eastern region of Colombia, between the Si­
erra Nevada de Santa Marta massif (SM) to the north and the Serrania de 
Perija (SP) range to the south, in a geographic region known as the La 
Loma plains (Fig. 1). According to Cediel and Shaw (2019), Paleocene 
fluvial-lacustrine sediments, shallow marine sediments, and coarse 
fluvial sediments were deposited along with the early Eocene inversion 
of the SP range that converted the CRB into an incipient foreland basin. 
Two periods of uplifting have been recognised throughout the basin, 
resulting in the absence of sections for the Sub Eocene to Sub Oligocene 
and late Miocene periods. This has left unconformities in the strati­
graphic record. Structurally, the study field known regionally as the La 
Loma Syncline is divided into four main synclines or structural com­
partments: Boqueron, Loma, Chimilla, and the Descanso. These com­
partments are separated by basement-involved south-east dipping 
reverse faults, presumably resulting from the Caribbean–South Amer­
ican plate interaction (Cediel and Shaw, 2019; Sanchez and Mann, 
2015) (Fig. 1B). 
Coal beds in the basin range in depth from 53 m to 538 m when 
intersected in exploratory and producing wells in the Boqueron 
compartment, with a maximum depth of 1600 m in the axis of the La 
Loma Syncline. According to seismic data interpretations, the Mid 
Paleocene to the Late Paleocene Cuervos Formation in the Cesar Sub- 
basin was deposited in a transitional contact with the underlying 
Barco Formation (Fig. 1C). It contains almost 80 coal beds (Drummond 
Ltd, 2012) that spread across the sedimentary unit in the basin (Fig. 1). 
Hydrogeologically, the Cesar Rancheria Basin belongs to the Atlantic 
coastal shed province. This province is divided into four sub-provinces, 
of which the Cesar plains are the sub-province for the study field. 
Hydrogeological units of the study area have been classified into two 
types. The first consists of continuous aquifers of limited regional 
extension (Qlla) and local extension (Qal) with unconfined, semi- 
confined, and confined types (Fig. 4). The second type of aquifer con­
sists of non-continuous confined to semi-confined aquifers of limited 
regional extension (Tpb) (Angel Martinez and Huguett Granados, 1995). 
Flow direction in the study field follows a general south-westward di­
rection flux following the regional dip direction of the Tertiary forma­
tions (Fig. 4). 
3. Previous research on water and gas chemistry and gas origin 
in the Cesar Sub-basin 
Since the early 1990s, interest in CBM has motivated research (pri­
marily government studies) to address gas resources in twelve coal ba­
sins in Colombia. Arguably, the most significant studies of CBM water 
and gas chemistry were carried out in 2013 and 2015 by the National 
Hydrocarbons Agency (Agencia Nacional de Hidrocarburos) (ANH). 
These studies were not able to apply isotopic analysis. The gas origin was 
assumed to be biogenic, based on the presence of gas and the low rank of 
coal samples collected from surface; however, it was also hypothesised 
to have migrated from deeper, more mature source rocks (Agencia 
Nacional de Hidrocarburos, 2013). To the authors’ knowledge, this 
study is the first attempt in Colombia to analyse water and gas from a 
CBM-producing field to test the theory of thermogenic/biogenic CBM 
gas origin and methanogenic processes. 
3.1. Coal composition and gas content 
Typically, the overall ash content of the CRB coals on a dry basis 
ranges from 0.9 to 16% with a mean of 4.0%, whereas total moisture 
varies between 8 and 21%. Volatile matter values range from 37 to 49% 
with values similar to those presented by Glencore International (2011) 
(Table 1, Fig. 2). The predominant maceral group in the study field is 
vitrinite, ranging from 57 to 88% with a mean of 74.96%, followed by 
inertinite (7–40%, mean 21.9%) and liptinite (0.8–4.5%, mean 2.02%). 
Coal rank varies with depth within the compartments from sub- 
bituminous to high volatile bituminous C, as per calorific data in the 
study field (Fig. 2). 
Fig. 2B presents calorific value differentiated for each compartment, 
with the minimum (13,276 BTU/lbm), mean (13,818 BTU/lbm) and 
maximum (14,242 BTU/lbm) values, from samples collected up to 
depths of 538 m. This graph shows a higher average calorific value for 
the Boqueron compartment and lower values for Descanso and La Loma. 
Data from Descanso presents a broader distribution, which indicates that 
this compartment has significant variability of coal maturation. 
Desorbed gas content from sixteen exploratory wells across three 
compartments in the study field showed relatively low to high gas 
content from 57 m to 538 m depth. Medium to high gas content was 
identified after 200 m depth in the Boqueron and La Loma compart­
ments, whereas in the Descanso compartment, CBM concentrations are 
relatively low in the upper coal-bearing strata with an increase in des­
orbed gas after approximately 350 m (Fig. 3).

field within the Cesar Sub-basin, a sampling campaign was conducted, 
collecting gas and water samples from 16 multi-seam completion wells 
(from 505 m to 802 m max. depth) and 5 samples from piezometers (up 
to 200 m depth) for isotopic analysis, all within the Boqueron 
compartment (Figs. 1, 4, and Table 2). Throughout this study, we will 
refer to “CBM wells” for co-produced waters, and “shallow wells” or 
“piezometers” for non-CBM water. At the time of field data collection 
(July 2019), there were no boreholes available for underground water/ 
gas sampling in the La Loma and Descanso compartments. Therefore, the 
present study focuses on the southern part of the CSB. This study did not 
include samples from the Rancheria Sub-basin. 
Groundwater samples were collected in 60 mL high density poly­
ethylene (HDPE) plastic bottles after rinsing them three times with 
formation water. The filling method for samples involved leaving suf­
ficient space to allow for freezing during air cargo shipment. After 
collection, samples remained in a cool shipping container until arrival at 
the laboratory. Gas samples were collected directly from the wellhead in 
110 mL capacity isotubes. Stable isotope analyses were undertaken by 
the Stable Isotope Geochemistry Laboratory (SIGL) of the School of 
Earth and Environmental Sciences at the University of Queensland, 
Australia. 
Water and gas isotopic analysis included δ13C-DIC‰ (dissolved 
inorganic carbon isotopes), δ18O-H2O‰ and δ2H-H2O‰ (water iso­
topes), and δ13C-CH4‰, δ2H-CH4‰, and δ13C-CO2‰ (gas isotopes). 
Units per mil on the scales of Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite (VPDB‰ and 
VSMOW‰) were normalised to the standard values proposed by Craig 
(1961) and updated by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 
A Thermo Delta V with Gasbench was used for δ13C-DIC analysis, and 
an Isoprime Dual Inlet IRMS for δ2H-H2O and δ18O-H2O analyses. δ13C- 
DIC values were normalised to the VPDB scale following a 3-point 
normalisation against international standards NBS18, NBS19, and 
USGS44, with a precision of ±0.1‰ at 1 σ. δ2H-H2O and δ18O-H2O 
values were normalised to the VSMOW scale via a 3-point normalisation 
using international standards USGS45, USGS46, and W64444, with a 
precision of ±0.1‰ for δ18O and ± 2‰ for δ2H at 1 σ. 
An Isoprime GC-c-IRMS was used for the determination of δ13C-CH4, 
δ2H-CH4, and δ13C-CO2. Each sample was analysed in duplicate with two 
injections per analytical cycle. Calibration was via 3-point normalisation 
using a combination of methane, carbon dioxide and hydrogen stan­
dards with a precision of ±0.1‰ for δ13C-CH4 and δ13C-CO2 at 1 σ, and 
± 3‰ for δ2H-CH4. The international standards used for the calibrations 
were OZTECH hydrogen (−125, −228, −365‰) and CO2 (−3.6,

−40.7‰) in combination with laboratory methane and carbon dioxide 
standards, with additional standards analysed as unknowns. Additional 
details on analytical equipment, procedure and calibration can be found 
in Baublys et al. (2015). Water quality analysis for physicochemical 
composition was completed in a certified laboratory in Colombia. 
Sampling methodology followed the approach described by Baublys 
et al. (2015) and Kinnon et al. (2010) for both the water and gas sam­
ples, and was adapted for the research data-management plan created 
for this study. 
5. Gas origin determination methods 
Different techniques have been proposed to determine gas origin, 
including coal rank and vitrinite reflectance value (Claypool and Kaplan, 
1974, in Pramod et al., 2014) and gas molecular composition ratios 
(Golding et al., 2013; Pramod et al., 2014). However, the most widely 
used method applies stable isotopic ratios. Studies by Schoell (1980), 
Whiticar (1999), and Whiticar et al. (1986) have analysed methane from 
a variety of sedimentary environments. These studies compared the 
stable carbon and hydrogen isotopes in methane to create diagrams that 
distinguish δ13C-CH4 and δ2H-CH4 values of methane from different 
sources, and to differentiate between methanogenic pathways. There are 
alternative methods to test gas origin of CBM gases, including the rela­
tionship between carbon isotopes of methane and carbon dioxide, and 
hydrogen isotopes of methane and water (Golding et al., 2013; Milkov 
and Etiope, 2018). In addition, CO2 produced during the stages of the

coalification process is variable in amount, while the isotopic compo­
sition of δ13C-CO2 varies in response to a variety of sources and meth­
anogenic pathways. Such variability, when paired with δ13C-CH4 values, 
is described as the carbon isotope fractionation (αCO2-CH4 and αCH4- 
H2O), and may allow differentiation between CO2 reduction and methyl- 
type fermentation systems (Flores et al., 2008; Golding et al., 2013). 
Oxygen and hydrogen isotopes of co-produced waters from CBM 
wells are assessed against the Global Meteoric Waterline (GMWL), 
which refers to the best fit of the relationship between hydrogen and 
oxygen isotope ratios (δ2HH2O = 8.13 * δ18OH2O + 10.8) in terrestrial 
waters (Craig, 1961). Several authors (Golding et al., 2013; Pantano, 
2012; Rice et al., 2008; Riese et al., 2005) have identified that waters co- 
produced from coal beds were typically enriched in 2H and depleted in 
18O relative to the GMWL (i.e. plotting above and to the left of the 
GMWL defined by Craig (1961)). Isotope studies in coal beds in the 
Walloon coals in Australia have linked waters with less negative δ2H- 
H2O and δ18O to high water production at shallow depths, whereas more 
negative δ2H-H2O and δ18O-H2O was correlated with high gas yield and 
lower dewatering (Kinnon et al., 2010). As such, this study applies a 
variety of determination methods involving stable isotope ratio analysis 
and hydrogeochemistry to investigate the extent of biogenesis/ther­
mogenesis in the CSB. Accordingly, the analytical approach to establish 
gas origin and generation pathways in the present study is firmly 
grounded in the relevant literature (Clayton, 1998; Golding et al., 2013; 
Hamilton et al., 2020; Milkov and Etiope, 2018; Vinson et al., 2017; 
Whiticar, 1999). 
6. Results and discussion 
6.1. Water chemistry 
Analysed water and gas samples included in this study were collected 
exclusively from the Boqueron compartment (Figs. 1, 4), because at the 
time of sampling (August 2019) there were no active production wells in 
the other two areas. CBM pilot wells in this area intersect and drain 
multiple seams over a depth range of 30 m to 600 m. Elevated coal rank 
and highest gas contents are found in this location in comparison with 
the other two structurally divided compartments. The main water 
quality parameters and composition of collected waters are summarised 
in Table 2, including pH, cations, anions, conductivity, total dissolved 
solids, total alkalinity, and ionic balance. CBM production waters from 
the Cuervos Formation are highly alkaline, as expected for deeper 
groundwaters (up to 600 m). Shallow groundwaters typically exhibit 
lower levels of alkalinity, as a result of chemical dissolution and solution 
reactions affecting recharge water along the flow path (Baublys et al., 
2015; Voast and Montana, 2003). 
The pH of the CBM wells ranges from 8.14 to 8.46 with an average of 
8.37, whereas water from the shallow groundwater wells exhibits 
anomalously high values with an average pH of 9.28 and a maximum of 
11.30. Extremely alkaline groundwater rarely occurs in nature, and is 
typically found only in thermal springs, ultramafic terrains, or hyper­
saline evaporative lakes (Roadcap et al., 2005). Human activities such as 
industrial waste could potentially produce pH values above 10 units 
(Roadcap et al., 2005). Agencia Nacional de Hidrocarburos-Colciencias 
(2015) have analysed physicochemical parameters of 14 surface samples 
from coalmines in the Cesar Sub-basin, resulting in pH values between 
6.91 and 8.31. Therefore, there is no additional evidence to support such 
high pH values, and they may be erroneous. 
Total average alkalinity for CBM wells is 2349.35 (SD = 874.5), 
compared to 173.88 mg/L (SD = 240) for shallow wells (>50 m) (Fig. 5). 
Across the study area, major ions for CBM waters are dominated by Na+
with concentrations between 678 and 2200 mg/L, followed by HCO3
−
(1260–3747 mg/L) and Cl−(57–973 mg/L). Shallow waters (eastern 
CBM wells Fig. 4) exhibit the same major ions in lower concentrations, 
apart from a higher Ca2+ value. SO4
2−, Mg2+, Ca2+, and K+ have lower 
concentrations, near the detection limits for shallow piezometers.

Relative distribution of major cations and anions is shown in the 
Scholler and Piper diagrams in Figs. 5 and 6 respectively. These signa­
tures indicate that the water type is HCO3
−> Na+ > Cl−for the CBM 
wells, while most of the shallow groundwaters display hydro­
geochemical facies HCO3
−- Ca2
+ to HCO3
−- Na+. Concentrations of 
Fe2
+, F−and Al+3 (avg. 0.32, 0.98, and 0.36 mg/L, respectively) are very 
low in the CBM wells, with higher values in the shallow groundwater. 
Total alkalinity as bicarbonate values in the study field ranges from 
31.14 to 3934 mg/L with an average value of 1910 mg/L. Fig. 7 shows 
Spearman’s rank pairwise correlations for major ions, pH, total alka­
linity, and distance of sampling point to the outcrop (i.e. horizontal 
distance between the sampling point and the formation outcrop 
following up dip). Correlations confirm that the determinant compounds 
of TDS are Na+, Cl−, and HCO3
−, with a strong positive correlation with 
total alkalinity (0.93, 0.61, and 0.99, respectively). High chlorine and 
sodium concentrations (57–973 mg/L and 486–2203 mg/L, respec­
tively) may reflect past marine or marine-transitional environments. 
Sulphate levels (avg. 11 mg/L) match with data from basins worldwide 
where biogenic methane has been generated. Finally, bicarbonate 
enrichment (avg. 2122 mg/L) is indicative of carbonate dissolution 
processes by recharge waters and sulphate reduction (Flores, 2014; 
Voast and Montana, 2003) (Fig. 7). 
Principal component analysis (PCA) with clustering was conducted 
using R-studio and the ‘Factoextra’ and ‘FactoMineR’ R Packages to 
identify the association between major ions and water physicochemical 
properties in the study field. PCA is a common statistical method used to 
identify the pattern of similarity among inter-correlated dependent 
variables (Abdi and Williams, 2010). Components included in the PCA 
analysis were the major ions of Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, Cl−, SO4
2−, and 
HCO3
−, in addition to pH. The total dissolved solids parameter was not 
included in this analysis since it is represented by the major ions. 
Following the Kaiser criterion (Kaiser et al., 1994), for which eigen­
values greater than 1 are considered for the hydrogeochemistry dataset, 
PCs 1 and 2 explain 63.78% of the variance. PCs 3 to 7 represent vari­
ance between 13 and 4%, indicating that the data is statistically divided 
into three clusters (Fig. 8). PC1 describes 41.1% of database variability, 
with positive loadings for Na+, Cl−, and HCO3
−, whereas PC2 has pos­
itive loadings for Ca2+ and Mg2+. In agreement with the Scholler plots 
(Fig. 5), ionic concentration relationships identified in the clusters 
correspond to the type of waters found in the Raton and Piceance basins 
(Voast and Montana, 2003), with association of significant concentra­
tions of sodium, bicarbonate, and chloride in PC1, and calcium‑mag­
nesium type waters in PC2. 
6.2. Gas molecular composition 
Table 3 shows the gas chromatography database analysed in this 
study, which includes CBM appraisal wells and deeper wells drilled to 
test shale gas reservoirs. A comparison of these data was undertaken 
where possible. Gas molecular composition is highly variable across 
different basins and coal types. Gas molecular and isotopic composition 
are ruled by expulsion, migration, and sorption variability, whereas gas 
wetness is largely controlled by source and maturity (Golding et al., 
2013 and references therein; Rice, 1993). Chemical composition of the 
Fig. 7. Correlation plots for major ions, pH, total alkalinity, and distance to sub-crop in CBM co-produced waters. Lower panel shows correlation scatter plots 
between the set of parameters; diagonal plots show a non-normal distribution of each parameter; upper panels show correlation Spearman coefficient (where + 1 =
positive correlation and −1 = negative correlation). The bigger the font size, the higher the correlation; red stars indicate correlation significance ρ-value specifying 
the strength of the correlation, with more stars signifying higher significance. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is

gas in the Cuervos Formation is on average 98.23% CH4, 1.26% CO2, 
0.24% N2, and 0.43% C+. On the other hand, the average molecular 
composition for the shale gas wells is 94% CH4, 1.77% CO2, 0.67% N2, 
and 1.85% C+. 
The ratio of methane to the sum of ethane and propane (C1/(C2 +
C3)) is commonly used to differentiate between microbial and thermo­
genic gases. Thus, microbial gas is generally higher than 1000 (unitless), 
whereas thermogenic gas usually presents values less than 100 (Bernard, 
1978; Faiz and Hendry, 2006; Ghosh et al., 2018; Strąpo´
c et al., 2008; 
Whiticar, 1996). Gas dryness calculated for the database spans from 
86.81 to 16,000. Lower values of gas dryness account for high C+ gases, 
particularly for the wells Caporo-1, Caporo-3, and Caporo-2, whereas 
high values represent less than 0.01% C+. 
6.3. Gas stable isotopes 
Thermal and biogenic processes in coal beds can be identified by the 
interpretation of methane, carbon, and hydrogen isotopes, and their 
combination with the molecular composition (Golding et al., 2013; 
Strąpo´
c et al., 2007; Strąpo´
c et al., 2008; Whiticar, 1996). The carbon 
isotope composition of thermogenic methane generally ranges from 
−50‰ to −20‰ for δ13C-CH4, while the hydrogen isotope ratio ranges 
from −275‰ to −100‰. Bacterial methane has δ13C-CH4 values from 
−110‰ to −50‰, and δD-CH4 values from −400‰ to −150‰ (Whiti­
car, 1999). These values are not strictly absolute; therefore, a combi­
nation of methods is essential for an accurate interpretation (Golding 
et al., 2013; Milkov and Etiope, 2018; Vinson et al., 2017). Table 4 
presents stable isotopic ratios of samples analysed in the CRB La Loma 
Field, with values from −65.1‰ to −60.3‰ for δ13C-CH4, and from 
−211‰ to −189‰ for δ2H-CH4. Updated genetic diagrams modified 
from Milkov and Etiope (2018) were used to show the correlation be­
tween methane carbon isotopes and the gas dryness ratio, where the four 
samples with both isotopic and molecular data plot in the primary mi­
crobial gas origin field (Fig. 9). 
A microbial gas origin was also confirmed by the methane, carbon, 
and hydrogen isotope systematics (Fig. 10); however, the samples plot 
on the boundary between the primary and secondary microbial field. 
Hence, in Fig. 10, all gas samples (n = 20) plot in the carbonate

to the centre of the graph, the less representative is the variance. Values in the table represent loadings for each variable in the principal component.

reduction field that indicates a biogenic origin. The samples also plot in 
the carbonate reduction field in the traditional classification diagrams 
for determining gas origin (presented as Whiticar-style plots) (Fig. 11), 
whereas CBM gases of secondary microbial origin typically plot in the 
mixed gas field in this diagram (Golding et al., 2013; Hamilton et al., 
2020). 
The mean hydrogen isotopic difference (ΔDH2O–CH4) of −157.4‰ 
agrees with the expected isotopic fractionation for hydrogenotrophic 
methanogenesis (Schoell, 1980; Strąpo´
c et al., 2007). Moreover, the 
observed 65.5‰ mean carbon isotopic difference (Δ13CH2O–CH4) be­
tween carbon dioxide and methane corresponds to the typical microbial 
CO2 reduction pathway (Golding et al., 2013; Smith and Pallasser, 1996; 
Strąpo´
c et al., 2007). 
CO2 concentration in coal bed gases varies across a wide range, 
reflecting multiple sources including atmospheric sources, soil sources, 
microbially generated gas, kerogen thermal maturation, or magmatic 
sources (Golding et al., 2013). The gas origin is commonly evaluated 
using the relationship between carbon isotopic composition and CO2 
concentration. Carbon dioxide concentrations in the study field (n = 5) 
range from 0.01 to 4.08% (Table 3), while δ13C-CO2 values range from 
1.9 to 3.8‰ (Table 4). The methanogenic pathway was also evaluated 
through the carbon isotope fractionation (Δ13CCO2-CH4), where the 
observed values range from 66.3 to 64.7. Most common carbon isotope 
fractionation values for the CO2 reduction pathway lie between 60‰ to 
80‰ (Golding et al., 2013). Fig. 13 shows the carbon isotope

fractionation plot of δ13C-CO2 versus δ13C-CH4 (adapted from Milkov 
and Etiope (2018)), in which the samples plot in the primary microbial 
field, close to the boundary of the secondary microbial gas field. It 
should be noted that limited data were available on δ13C-CO2 in our 
dataset. 
6.4. Water stable isotopes 
Analytics applied to water samples included stable isotopes of δ2H- 
H2O, δ18O-H2O, and δ13C-DIC (dissolved inorganic carbon). Table 4 
provides carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen isotopic values of gas and water 
in the study field. As expected, isotopic depletion trends mirror water 
chemistry; thus, water samples falling below the GMWL have lower 
values for HCO3
−, Na+, and Cl−. On the other hand, waters plotting 
above and to the left of the GMWL have higher concentrations of total 
dissolved solids (TDS) represented by HCO3
2−and Na+ as principal 
determinants (Fig. 14). Water hydrogen isotope values range from 
−59.9 to −22.1‰, while water oxygen isotope values span between 
−8.4 and −3.1‰. (Fig. 14). Similarly, the plot of δ18O‰ versus δ2H‰ 
for samples classified according to sample source reveals differences 
between the waters from the CBM wells, shallow aquifers, and deeper 
aquifers. Thus, waters from shallow alluvial and sandy Barco Formation 
plot below and to the right of the GMWL. The set of samples from the 
CBM wells exhibit two different trends: wells close to the outcrop (i.e. 
shallow coal-bearing wells) plot below and to the right of the GWML, 
whereas wells away from the outcrop plot above and to the left of the 
GMWL (Fig. 14). 
Several studies have outlined the causes of shifts in water isotopic 
composition relative to the GMWL. Groundwater isotopic ratios to the 
right of the GMWL are the result of factors such as mixing with older 
formation waters, progressive evaporation, and water-rock interaction 
under high-temperature conditions (Hamilton et al., 2014; Hamilton 
et al., 2020; Kinnon et al., 2010). Processes that shift isotopic compo­
sition to the left of the GMWL include precipitation of carbonates and 
clays, and formation of clays by hydrolysis of feldspars and lithics in 
sandstone (Hamilton et al., 2014; Hamilton et al., 2020; Kinnon et al., 
2010). Methanogenesis in CBM co-produced waters is thought to be an 
alternative process that can result in water isotope values that plot to the 
left of the GMWL, preferentially removing light hydrogen from water 
and allowing 2H enrichment (Baublys et al., 2015; Hamilton et al., 2014; 
Hamilton et al., 2020; Kinnon et al., 2010). Changes in climate condi­
tions may explain opposite depletion along the GMWL line (Fig. 14), 
where CBM wells closer to the outcrop and shallow coal-bearing strata 
show less 2H and 18O-depleted values. Surprisingly, co-produced waters 
from deeper coal beds, or those further from the outcrop, exhibit more 
positive values, in opposition to the trend expected for older waters 
(Hamilton et al., 2020). 
6.5. Dissolved inorganic carbon isotopes (δ13C-DIC) 
The literature on dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) highlights the 
association of high DIC levels and 13C-enriched carbon isotopic 
composition with secondary biogenic gas generation (Golding et al., 
Fig. 11. Isotopic relation between carbon and hydrogen isotopes in methane. 
Modified from (Golding et al., 2013; Whiticar, 1999). A biogenic origin for coal 
bed gases from the Cesar Sub-basin via a hydrogenotrophic pathway (CO2 
reduction) is also confirmed by the hydrogen isotope difference between the 
hydrogen isotopes of methane and co-produced water (δ2H-CH4 vs. δ2H- 
H2O) (Fig. 12).

dashed lines enclose the typical ΔDH2O–CH4 range for the microbial CO2

and possibly indicate methane oxidation and mixing gases. (For interpretation

2013; Martini et al., 1998; Quillinan and Frost, 2014). In the literature, 
DIC observed in waters associated with biogenic gas generation via the 
carbonate reduction pathway commonly have positive δ13C-DIC values 
(10‰ to 30‰), whereas most other waters associated with thermogenic 
influences have negative δ13C-DIC values (−12‰ to −7‰) (Golding 
et al., 2013; Martini et al., 1998; Quillinan and Frost, 2014). δ13C-DIC 
values observed in the Cesar Sub-basin in the study field span from 
−28.1‰ to 9.7‰, with a clear differentiation between waters from CBM 
wells (−0.9‰ to 9.7‰) and those from shallow aquifers collected from 
piezometers (−28.1‰ to −5‰) (Fig. 15). δ13C-DIC values paired with 
high alkalinity showed in Fig. 16 are also an indicator of methanogenesis 
(Baublys et al., 2015). While high alkalinity may be the result of bac­
terial sulphate reduction, this typically results in 13C-depleted DIC car­
bon isotopes. Fig. 16 shows that this is not the case, displaying high 
alkalinity and positive δ13C-DIC values. 
DIC carbon isotopes are also a common indicator of the degree of 
methanogenesis, groundwater mixing, and volume of gas generation. 
The literature indicates that coal beds in the Atlantic Rim, as well as in 
the Powder River Basin, exhibit a progressive enrichment in δ13C-DIC 
with increasing depth (Quillinan, 2011). This enrichment is likely the 
result of the microbial consumption of light carbon during CO2 reduc­
tion (Golding et al., 2013). Water samples from the study field showed 
the same trend over a relatively short distance of ~4 km from outcrop to 
the farthest sample from the outcrop. 
6.6. Summary of findings and discussion 
The main goals of this study were to understand the occurrence, 
origin, and associated geological characteristics of coal seam gases in 
sub-bituminous to high volatile bituminous Cuervos Formation, Cesar 
Sub-basin (CS) through the analysis and interpretation of physical and 
chemical data and stable isotopes of gas and water (Sanchez and Mann, 
2015). 
The geochemical characteristics of water from the Scholler and Piper 
type diagrams showed differences between shallow aquifers and CBM 
wells, generally analogous to those from CBM basins worldwide. CBM- 
produced waters of the Cesar Sub-basin are of the HCO3
2+ > Na+ >
Cl−type, whereas shallow waters from both piezometers and eastern 
CBM wells (Fig. 4) depicted an HCO3
2+ > Ca2+ and HCO3
2+ > Mg2+
composition. Generally, these values are lower than reported for

methane-producing basins; this may be due to proximity to freshwater 
recharge zones (Voast and Montana, 2003). 
Laboratory results reported the same SO4
2−value across the dataset 
for the CBM wells, with an average of 11 mg/L. This is a low value, 
which may indicate biochemical reduction of sulphate along the 
groundwater flow path (Baublys et al., 2015; Voast and Montana, 2003). 
The main constituents in the water (accounting for 90% of TDS) are 
HCO3
2+, Na+, and Cl−, with increasing concentrations south-east into 
the basin and away from outcrop and the open cut area. By contrast, 
Mg2+ and Ca2+ concentrations decrease with depth as a result of inor­
ganic precipitation of calcite and dolomite in the presence of high 
HCO3
2+ concentrations (Voast and Montana, 2003). Minor ions in 
studied waters are K+, Fe2+, CO3
2−, and NO3
−. Methane dominates gas 
molecular composition in the Boqueron study field, with an average of 
98.23% for CH4, and minor amounts of 1.26% for CO2, 0.24% for N2, 
and 0.43% for C+. Gas dryness ratio indicates mostly dry gases associ­
ated with microbial activity, which seems to corroborate gas composi­
tion and isotopic data specifically for methane isotope composition. 
The plot of δ18O‰ versus δ2H‰ displays two clusters for CBM water 
samples: one for samples above the GMWL, and the other below. Several 
authors have proposed that water samples above the GMWL may have 
been modified by microbial activity (Baublys et al., 2015; Craig, 1961; 
Golding et al., 2013; Hamilton et al., 2014; Hamilton et al., 2015). 
Higher total dissolved solids correlate with water samples lying above 
the GMWL, whereas those with lower TDS tend to plot below the GMWL. 
This likely reflects the combined effects of fluid–rock interaction and 
microbial processes. Molecular composition of the gas in the Cuervos 
Formation is, on average, 98.23% CH4, 1.26% CO2, 0.24% N2, and 
0.43% C+. Methane carbon and hydrogen isotopes, along with molec­
ular composition, suggest a biogenic gas origin for CBM in the Cesar Sub- 
basin, as well as methanogenic formation of methane via the CO2 
reduction pathway. In support of this, positive values of δ13C-DIC in the 
study field are consistent with a biogenic gas origin of CBM in the Cesar 
Sub-basin. 
This study presents evidence of biogenic gas, with hydrogentrophic 
methanogenesis as the main pathway. However, the main discussion 
centres around a primary versus secondary biogenic origin, since the 
burial history of the basin suggests that secondary biogenesis might have 
occurred. As this paper’s anonymous reviewers noted, while isotopes 
show in situ methanogenesis in the groundwater and mixing of connate 
and meteoric waters, these events in principle must have resulted from 
uplifting in the basin, with the consequent generation of secondary 
biogenic gas. Analytics such as gas dryness ratio, gas composition, and 
different cross plots between hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen isotopes 
from co-produced gas and waters show a biogenic gas origin as a by- 
product of the hydrogenotrophic methanogenic pathway. Whiticar- 
style plots confirmed a CO2 methanogenic pathway, but made no 
conclusion in relation to primary or secondary biogenesis. Meanwhile, 
revised diagenetic plots from Milkov and Etiope (2018) are equivocal 
regarding primary versus secondary biogenesis, since the gas isotope 
compositions plot close to the boundary between the primary and sec­
ondary biogenic gas fields (Figs. 9, 13). These authors have highlighted 
the possibility of misinterpreting early mature thermogenesis as primary 
microbial gases—for instance, in the case of the Illinois Basin, where 
deeper thermogenic gas was mixed with new microbial methane 
through uplift (Strąpo´
c et al., 2010). Other parameters and indices such 
as gas dryness, the isotopic difference of Δ2HH2O–CH4 and Δ13CH2O–CH4, 
the carbon isotope fractionation of δ13C-CO2 versus δ13C-CH4, and the 
positive δ13C-DIC values are indicative of the CO2 reduction pathway, 
but do not in themselves distinguish between primary and secondary 
microbial methanogenesis. 
On the other hand, according to studies on thermal maturation based 
on vitrinite reflectance and sorption isotherms in the CRB (ANH, 2011; 
Sanchez and Mann, 2015), the Cuervos Formation was deposited during 
an abrupt pulse of subsidence in the Paleocene–Early Eocene, followed 
by a regional erosive event that took place between the early Eocene to 
pre-Oligocene. However, “the La Loma syncline […] shows a well pre­
served Paleogene and Neogene section, indicating reduced exhumation 
[…] because of its distant location from overthrusting mountain fronts 
bounding the CRB” (Sanchez and Mann, 2015, p. 454). This compres­
sional burial setting with a tectonic quiescence may have preserved 
early biogenic gas in the coal; however, the evidence of mixing between 
connate and meteoric waters makes this unlikely. It is also possible that 
the commonly observed differences in the isotope systematics of pri­
mary and secondary microbial gas (Milkov and Etiope, 2018) primarily 
reflect the degree of openness in the system. In this context, Baublys 
et al. (2015) have shown that the Walloon Subgroup of the Surat Basin, 
Queensland, functions as a stagnant aquifer and that the groundwaters 
and methane are older than previously thought. In such a setting, sub­
strate limitation results in the less negative δ13C-CH4 and the strongly 
positive δ13C-DIC values typically observed in secondary biogenic gases 
relative to primary biogenic gases (Hamilton et al., 2014; Hamilton 
et al., 2015; Milkov and Etiope, 2018). On the other hand, Hamilton 
et al. (2020) have determined that most gas samples from a CBM pro­
duction field in the Bowen Basin, Queensland, had methane and carbon 
dioxide stable isotopes consistent with secondary biogenesis; these 
samples nevertheless plotted close to the boundary between the sec­
ondary and primary microbial fields on a Milkov and Etiope δ13C-CO2 
versus δ13C-CH4 plot. Further detailed studies on the isotopic chemistry 
across the basin, including carbon-14 dating, would assist a refined 
interpretation of gas generation phases in the Sub-basin between 
compartments. 
One unanticipated finding was identified through analysis of the 
relationship between oxygen and hydrogen isotopes, which served to 
differentiate between typical water from meteoric sources, and 
groundwaters that have experienced water–rock microbial reactions or 
mixing under low-temperature water conditions. Contrary to the ex­
pected findings, samples from shallow waters were depleted in the 
lighter isotopes, whereas deeper (i.e. older) waters showed less deple­
tion. This trend may be partly explained by differences in climatic/ 
latitude conditions between old meteoric recharge waters and more 
recent recharge. 
As the three compartments in the La Loma Syncline in CSB present 
particular structural settings (Fig. 1), the degree of gas generation may 
have also experienced a slightly different history. The data show higher 
average gas contents and coal rank in the Boqueron compartment, while 
the lowest gas content levels are found in the Descanso area. Structur­
ally, the Descanso compartment has a coal-bearing sequence around 
150 m above the stratigraphic level in the Boqueron compartment, as 
reported by Drummond Ltd (2012). In addition, there is a thinner 
overburden above the Descanso coal sequence in the north-west, and 
erosional truncation of the Cuervos Formation against the Eocene­
–Oligocene unconformity towards the south-west. The Loma compart­
ment also has high gas levels and higher coal rank, although these 
readings were derived from wells drilled in the flanks of the syncline. An 
Eocene sequence has been preserved in this compartment, putting the 
Cuervos Formation in a deeper structural position and allowing a higher 
temperature for methanogenesis. 
Due to the structural position of the Cuervos Formation in the Des­
canso compartment, it is possible that the systematics for biogenesis 
follow the same trend as in Boqueron. However, mixing waters are more 
likely due to the position of the formation near the surface below a thin 
alluvium. In the La Loma compartment, on the other hand, the idea of 
secondary biogenesis and early thermogenesis cannot be discarded, 
given the structural and stratigraphic settings of the deeper coal seams 
and the higher temperatures. More detailed sampling and testing of coal 
bed gases is required in these compartments.

This study examined the gas and water chemical characteristics of 
Cuervos Formation coal-bearing strata, analysing stable isotopic

composition, hydrogeochemistry and gas composition to identify water 
and gas origin, geochemical facies, and patterns between gas and water 
for producing wells. This research contributes to a better understanding 
of the geological conditions leading to the occurrence and distribution of 
coal bed gases in the Cesar Sub-basin and will assist with exploration 
targeting for future production. 
Coalification processes and associated early gas generation took 
place between the mid to late Paleocene, in which burial conditions 
allowed peat methanogens to produce carbon dioxide responsible for 
microbial reduction and methane generation. Isotope results indicate 
the presence of microbial gas at depths up to at least 530 m, possibly 
from the diagenetic process in which coal reached sub-bituminous to 
high volatile bituminous rank (Ro 0.4 to 0.6%), producing enough CO2 
to provide feedstock for primary biogenesis. Although most of the 
initially formed gas is presumed to have been lost prior to burial, Rice 
(1993) suggests that biogenic gas can be generated during gelification at 
early stages of burial at low ranks (Ro < 0.5%). This thesis is supported 
by the curial models cited, which suggest that the Cuervos Formation 
experienced a short period of burial and did not achieve temperatures 
conducive to thermogenesis. While the occurrence of thermogenic gases 
up to the maximum depth of 1.8 to 2 km at the base of the coal-bearing is 
not rejected, there is no isotopic evidence to suggest that they migrated 
upwards into the coal seams. 
Diagnostics such as water and gas isotopic analysis, water chemistry, 
and gas composition indicate that the analysed gas samples within the 
Boqueron compartment are of biogenic origin. Nevertheless, the 
geographical extent and location of the samples may indicate thermo­
genesis in the deeper coal sequence. Gas and water stable isotope 
composition from production wells confirmed biogenic gas origin 
through several cross plots; it also allowed the identification of a 
methanogenic pathway derived from CO2 reduction processes. The data 
clustered at the boundary between primary and secondary biogenesis, 
which was perplexing given the structural complexity in the area. This 
should be explored further through an analysis of gases and waters from 
the different structural compartments, coupled with age dating of the 
waters. 
Several questions remain to be answered. For instance, what is the 
correlation between the gas and water chemistry and gas and water 
production? Has the dewatering process accompanied chemical modi­
fications in cation/anion concentrations? What has been the gas 
composition variation as the reservoir was produced? According to the 
data analysed, potential areas for CBM development are in the La Loma 
and Descanso compartments below ~350 m depth, where higher rela­
tive saturation and gas contents were identified. In order to correlate 
these prospects, the drilling of a stratigraphic core well in the La Loma 
compartment crossing the entire coal sequence is recommended. This 
will allow access to core, gas, and water samples, providing a better 
understanding of gas origin and saturation among compartments paired 
with isotopic chemistry of coal bed methane waters and gases. 
Finally, this study’s findings for the Boqueron compartment must be 
tested against geochemical isotopic composition of production gas and 
waters in the La Loma and Descanso synclines across different depth 
ranges. Presumably, the La Loma compartment would have attained 
thermogenesis since higher ranks and gas contents have been identified 
by the operator company in exploration wells.
